		<ul class="divide">
			<li>Like the name suggests, everything is completely anonymous.</li>
			<li>Uploads are restricted to {{ MAX_PAYLOAD }} MB max.</li>
			<li>10 second interval between uploads.</li>
			<li>Uploads may be removed for any reason without notice.</li>
			<li>Anything is allowed, even the esoteric Brainfuck <code>.bf</code> file&mdash;unless it's something like child porn. Please keep your highly illegal files to yourself.</li>
			<li>Attempting to flood my disk won't work so don't try.</li>
			<li>This is not a file backup service. I am not accountable for any lost files.</li>
			<li>In the even that a wipe occurs to free up space, the least recently used files are deleted first.</li>
			<li>Don't make me turn on logging.</li>
			<li>Don't be an ass.</li>
			<li>Uploads are not modified in any way so be sure to remove sensitive metadata before uploading.</li>
			<li>Any questions or inquiries should be emailed to <a href="mailto:phantom@reticent.io">phantom@reticent.io</a>.</li>
